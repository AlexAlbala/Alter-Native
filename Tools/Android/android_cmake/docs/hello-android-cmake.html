<html><body><pre>Hello Android CMake
<h3>
Introduction
-------------
</h3>
Lets now get our jni library running on android
<h3>
I. Requirements
----------------
</h3>
Android sdk, eclipse plugin. (if you're here, we'll assume you have and are
comfortable with these)

Built the <a href="hello-cmake.html">Hello CMake</a> project.

<h3>  
II. Open eclipse project
----------------
</h3>
Open up eclipse and start an android project from existing source. Select the
hello-android-cmake directory.

Assuming you built and installed the native libraries, you should be able to
run on an emulator or device with out issue. Verify that there are libhello-cmake.so
files in the libs/armeabi and libs/armeabi-v7a directories.

I dupplicated the HelloWorld.java file from the Hello CMake tutorial in the source
folder for simplicity, but you could also import an existing <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/faq/commontasks.html#addexternallibrary">java jar file</a>.

<h3>  
III. Ant Based Build (command line way)
----------------
</h3>
./project_create.sh
ant compile
ant install
