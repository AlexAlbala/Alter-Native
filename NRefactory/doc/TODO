Parser:
- put newlines into the AST
- add API to report errors
- allow multithreaded parsing

Resolver:
- Tons of unit tests for TypeSystemConvertVisitor
- Port all #D resolver unit tests to NR
- Port all MD resolver unit tests to NR
- Think about removing ParameterizedType and specializing the ITypeDefinition instead.

Features:
- Code Completion
- Extract Method refactoring

For integration into SharpDevelop:
- Review NR and DOM changes done in the timeframe



Idea for automated testing of the NR resolver:

Given some source code + the references,
  Compile source code with MS C# Compiler
  Load references into NR.TypeSystem
  Load source code into NR.TypeSystem
  Load compiled assembly into NR.TypeSystem
  Compare entities 3a. and 3b. (but ignore compiled-generated members - ILSpy has logic to detect those)
  For each method:
    Resolve whole method with ResolveVisitor
    Ensure there are no errors detected
    Extract list of methods being called (incl. op_Implicit etc.)
    Compare with methods being called in compiled assembly. (also compare type arguments)
