	/// When an <see cref="IResolveVisitorNavigator"/> is searching for specific nodes
	/// (e.g. all IdentifierExpressions), it has to scan the whole compilation unit for those nodes.
	/// However, scanning in the ResolveVisitor is expensive (e.g. any lambda that is scanned must be resolved),
	/// so it makes sense to detect when a whole subtree is scan-only, and skip that tree instead.
	/// 
	/// The DetectSkippableNodesNavigator performs this job by running the input IResolveVisitorNavigator
	/// over the whole AST, and detecting subtrees that are scan-only, and replaces them with Skip.
