==================
USING THE SOFTWARE
==================

Syntax: ptime command [arguments ...]

Note: ptime itself does not accept any command line switches or options.
Everything after 'ptime' on the command line is literally executed.

ptime will run the specified command and measure the execution time
(run time) in seconds, accurate to 5 millisecond or better. It is an
automatic process timer, or program timer.

For example, to time the command "DIR C:\ /S" use:
ptime dir c:\ /s

The specified command will be executed. Once it terminates, a final
line such as the following will be displayed:

Execution time: 5.675 s

The timer precision depends on the specific operating system. Under
Windows NT, the precision is 5 milliseconds or better.

As a general rule, don't take the 3rd decimal point too seriously.

CREDITS
=======

I was inspired by the UNIX ptime command. Searching the net, I couldn't
find a native win32 version of the program, so I wrote one.
